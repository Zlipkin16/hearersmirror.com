								<p>Hearer’s Mirror was founded in the summer of 2018 on a blow up mattress in New York City.
									While the studio apartment overlooked the beautiful Lincoln Center, the two bums who lived inside it were indeed jobless.
									So, out of necessity to find ways to pass the time, HM’s founder, Lippy, took to writing poetry and posting it on an anonymous Instagram .... </p>

									<p>We were cautioned about Rocky. That he might be tired or distracted at the end of the day, and I might get a half-hour out of him at best.
										<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
										But so far, things are going swimmingly. We’re at Milk Studios in West Hollywood, the two of us alone in this giant white cube of a room.
										The evening sun’s pouring through the skylight, as our voices echo off the walls, and his assistant Isabel comes by to say his weed won’t get here for an hour or so,
										but as luck would have it, I have a vape pen in my bag. So we’re all good.
										<br>

										Best of all, though, Rocky is talking about group sex. And that never happens in celebrity interviews. Even just among guys, orgies are a topic to work
										up to, you don’t just dive in. But Rocky likes talking about sex. He has rather a lot of it. So it wasn’t quite item one on the agenda, but it was close.
										We’ve only been sitting here six minutes or so.

										<br>
										I asked about his house, that’s how it started. He owns a mansion in Beverly Hills, on one of those picturesque boulevards that abut West
										Hollywood. "I interior-decorated the whole fucking thing," he says. "It’s all in the style of Tim Burton and Wes Anderson." He’s been a huge
										Burton fan since he saw The Nightmare Before Christmas when he was four.
										<br>

										Didn’t you design your own bed? I ask.
										<br>
										"Man, you did your research!"
										<br>
										I’ve never met anyone who designed their own bed before, let alone a famous rapper.
										<br>
										"Yeah man, lot of orgies. I’ve photographed and documented many of them."
										<br>
										"I was going to sell ’em, too, but it cost like 60, 80 grand for the prototype, so you know the bed’s going to be 100. How many people want to buy a luxury car for a bed?"
										<br>
										What’s a 100-grand bed like?
										<br>
										"Fucking gigantic. But I need it because I have a lot of orgies at my house with some very close female companions."
										<br>
										It was the way he said it, like it was nothing. The way I’d say I have an extra pillow to stop me from snoring.
										<br>
										"Yeah man, lot of orgies. I’ve photographed and documented many of them. The women that I’m around are into that
										free-spirited shit like me. Usually guys are insecure with working, successful women, they can’t handle it when
										it’s on the other foot, you know? So they get with a guy like me — they know I don’t want to break their hearts or
										nothing. And why not? Let’s smoke some good weed in the teepee and have a fun time! Heh heh!"

									<p> It’s been said that a man risks his marriage by coming home late—and may put it in even greater jeopardy by coming home early.
										Though he turns 25 next month, Justin Bieber believes that his late nights and their ruthlessly documented excesses are behind him.
										In their place, at this moment, the uncounted, uncertain hours of marriage stretch out, a red carpet hung like a tightrope.
