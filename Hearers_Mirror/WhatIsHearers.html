              Welcome to Hearer’s Mirror

              <br>

              Hearer’s Mirror was founded in the summer of 2018 on a blow up mattress in New York City.  While the studio apartment overlooked the beautiful Lincoln Center, the two bums who lived inside it were indeed jobless.  So, out of necessity to find ways to pass the time, HM’s founder, Lippy, took to writing poetry and posting it on an anonymous Instagram.

              <br>

              Hearer’s Mirror lived as a dumping ground for Lippy’s angst for some time.  Briefly in the winter of 2021, the page took a turn.

              <br>

              After a music executive told Lippy he had “no brand”, he started writing about up and coming hip hop artists he admired.  While that stint was short lived, we remain firm in our stance that the aforementioned music executive is an asshat (but he isn’t wrong).

              <br>

              Now, in the fall of 2021, Hearer’s Mirror will take a page out of Frieza’s book and evolve into its final form.  The site is intended to be a  mélange of thought which encompasses: poetry, music, sports, culture, education, nostalgia and so much more.

              <br>

              So, what is Hearer’s Mirror really?  Let’s find out together.

              <br>
